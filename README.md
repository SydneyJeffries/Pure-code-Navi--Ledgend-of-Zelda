<h4> The Navi </h4>
 <p> The Navi is made with pure HTML and CSS. The CSS properties that brought her to life were the border radiuses, box shadows and opacities. All of her is HTML/CSS except for her wings which are an SVG. To apperciate the work quality, closely watch the animation play out as soon as the page loads. https://codepen.io/sydney-jeffries/pen/omaLdL
